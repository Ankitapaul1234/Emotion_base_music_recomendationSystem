# 🎵 Emotion-Based Music Recommendation System

## 📌 Overview

The **Emotion-Based Music Recommendation System** is an intelligent application that detects a user’s emotion in real time using facial expressions and recommends suitable music accordingly.
The project combines **Computer Vision**, **Machine Learning**, and **Web-based interaction** to enhance the user’s listening experience based on their current mood.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Detect human emotions using facial landmarks
* Classify emotions using a trained ML model
* Recommend music that matches the detected emotion
* Provide a simple and interactive user interface

---

## 🧠 Emotions Supported

The system can detect and classify the following emotions:

* 😊 Happy
* 😢 Sad
* 😡 Angry
* 😮 Surprise
* 😐 Neutral
* 🙏 Prayer
* ⚡ Energetic
* 🌿 Calm

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

### 💻 Programming & Libraries

* **Python**
* **NumPy**
* **OpenCV**
* **MediaPipe**
* **TensorFlow / Keras**
* **Streamlit**

### 🤖 Machine Learning

* Facial landmark extraction using **MediaPipe**
* Emotion classification using a **trained deep learning model (.h5)**

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Webcam captures the user’s face
2. Facial landmarks are detected using MediaPipe
3. Landmarks are converted into feature vectors
4. ML model predicts the emotion
5. Songs related to the detected emotion are recommended
